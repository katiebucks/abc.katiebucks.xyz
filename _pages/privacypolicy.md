# Privacy Policy

## Our Commitment to Privacy
Katie Bucks the Invisible FUCKS! is built with privacy in mind. We do not track you, collect personal data, or serve ads. No third-party analytics, cookies, or scripts monitor your behavior. Your browsing experience is completely private.

## No Data Collection
This website does not collect, store, or share any personal data. There are no user accounts, no comments, and no forms requiring input. If you email us, that is the only time we see your information, and we do not retain it longer than necessary to respond.

## Onion Mirror for Anonymity
For increased anonymity, this website is also available as a Tor hidden service at [katiebucks.onion](http://katiebucks.onion). Using the Tor browser ensures your connection remains encrypted and untraceable.

## No Cookies or Trackers
We do not use cookies, session storage, local storage, or any form of tracking mechanism. Your visit is yours alone, with no records kept on our end.

## No Embedded Third-Party Services
There are no embedded videos, social media buttons, or external scripts. Any links to third-party sites are provided for reference, and we do not control their privacy policies.

## Contact, PGP Encryption, and GitHub Participation
If you wish to contact us securely, we recommend using PGP encryption. Our public key is available [here](/PGP.html). Additionally, the source code for this website is hosted on GitHub, and we encourage users to participate in improving security by reporting any bugs or vulnerabilities they find. You can contribute or submit issues on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/katiebucks).

## Policy Updates
This Privacy Policy may be updated at any time, but our core commitment to privacy will never change. If updates occur, they will be reflected on this page immediately.
