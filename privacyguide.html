            <li><strong>Install and Launch Tor:</strong> Follow the installation process, then open the browser.</li>
            <li><strong>Connect to the Tor Network:</strong> Click "Connect" to access the encrypted Tor network.</li>
            <li><strong>Browse .onion Sites:</strong> Visit sites like <a href="http://katiebucks.onion">katiebucks.onion</a> for enhanced privacy.</li>
            <li><strong>Never Use Personal Credentials:</strong> Avoid logging into accounts that reveal your identity.</li>
        </ol>
