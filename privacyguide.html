        <h2>The Internet Is Not Your Friend</h2>
        <p>Every click, search, and message you send is being logged‚Äîwhether by your internet provider, Big Tech, advertisers, or government agencies. Privacy is no longer just a niche concern for tech-savvy users; it‚Äôs about safeguarding your identity, data, and freedom.</p>
        <p>Still think this is paranoia? Watch <em>Snowden</em>‚Äîyes, the film from nearly 20 years ago. The surveillance programs exposed back then were alarming. Today, they‚Äôre far worse.</p>

        <h2>The Power of Inferred Data</h2>
        <p>It‚Äôs not just about the data you provide‚Äîit‚Äôs about the patterns they detect. Companies and governments track not just what you say online, but what you don‚Äôt say. This is known as inferred data.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You never told Facebook you were job hunting, but after searching for resume templates, LinkedIn ads flood your feed.</li>
            <li>You never posted political opinions, but your browsing habits suggest a preference‚Äîso your social media starts nudging you in a certain direction.</li>
            <li>You never mentioned financial struggles, but your purchase history and ad clicks flag you as a target for predatory loan offers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Dark Web 101: How to Use Tor</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Download Tor Browser:</strong> Get it from <a href="https://www.torproject.org" target="_blank">torproject.org</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Install & Open:</strong> Set it up like any other browser.</li>
            <li><strong>Click "Connect":</strong> Routes traffic through encrypted relays.</li>
            <li><strong>Visit .onion Sites:</strong> Try sites like <a href="http://katiebucks.onion">katiebucks.onion</a> for anonymous browsing.</li>
            <li><strong>Avoid Logging into Personal Accounts:</strong> Using Google or Facebook on Tor defeats the purpose.</li>
            <li><strong>Disable JavaScript:</strong> Prevents tracking and potential leaks (adjust this in settings).</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Never download anything from the dark web unless you fully understand the risks. Malicious files can expose your real identity‚Äîor worse.</p>
