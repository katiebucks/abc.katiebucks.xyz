        <h2>The Internet Is Not Your Friend</h2>
        <p>Every click, search, and message you send is being logged‚Äîwhether by your internet provider, Big Tech, advertisers, or government agencies. Privacy is no longer just a niche concern for tech-savvy users; it‚Äôs about safeguarding your identity, data, and freedom.</p>
        <p>Still think this is paranoia? Watch <em>Snowden</em>‚Äîyes, the film from nearly 20 years ago. The surveillance programs exposed back then were alarming. Today, they‚Äôre far worse.</p>

        <h2>Understanding Digital Surveillance</h2>
        <p>Governments, corporations, and advertisers employ various techniques to monitor users. Some of the most common forms of surveillance include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>IP Tracking:</strong> Websites log your IP address to determine your location and online activity.</li>
            <li><strong>Cookies:</strong> Small files stored in your browser that track user behavior across websites.</li>
            <li><strong>Fingerprinting:</strong> Advanced tracking that collects device, browser, and hardware information.</li>
            <li><strong>Metadata Collection:</strong> ISPs and telecom companies monitor your communication patterns and log data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Power of Inferred Data</h2>
        <p>It‚Äôs not just about the data you provide‚Äîit‚Äôs about the patterns they detect. Companies and governments track not just what you say online, but what you don‚Äôt say. This is known as inferred data.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You never told Facebook you were job hunting, but after searching for resume templates, LinkedIn ads flood your feed.</li>
            <li>You never posted political opinions, but your browsing habits suggest a preference‚Äîso your social media starts nudging you in a certain direction.</li>
            <li>You never mentioned financial struggles, but your purchase history and ad clicks flag you as a target for predatory loan offers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to Access the Dark Web Anonymously</h2>
        <p>One of the most effective ways to protect your privacy is by using the Tor network. The dark web, which consists of .onion sites, allows users to browse anonymously. Follow these steps to safely access Tor:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Download Tor Browser:</strong> Visit <a href="https://www.torproject.org" target="_blank">torproject.org</a> and download the latest Tor Browser.</li>
            <li><strong>Install and Launch Tor:</strong> Follow the installation process, then open the browser.</li>
            <li><strong>Connect to the Tor Network:</strong> Click "Connect" to access the encrypted Tor network.</li>
            <li><strong>Browse .onion Sites:</strong> Visit sites like <a href="http://katiebucks.onion">katiebucks.onion</a> for enhanced privacy.</li>
            <li><strong>Never Use Personal Credentials:</strong> Avoid logging into accounts that reveal your identity.</li>
            <li><strong>Disable JavaScript:</strong> Prevents tracking and potential leaks (adjust this in settings).</li>
        </ol>
