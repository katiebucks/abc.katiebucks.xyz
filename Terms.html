  <h2>What is FLOSS?</h2>
  <p>FLOSS (Free/Libre and Open Source Software) is software that grants users the freedom to use, study, modify, and share its source code. It embodies the principles of collaboration, transparency, and the belief that software should be accessible to all. FLOSS communities thrive on mutual respect and a shared goal of improving technology for everyone.</p>
  <p>Some well-known examples of FLOSS include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Linux</strong> - An open-source operating system kernel</li>
    <li><strong>Firefox</strong> - A free web browser</li>
    <li><strong>GIMP</strong> - A graphics editing software</li>
  </ul>
  <p>By supporting FLOSS, users contribute to a global ecosystem where innovation is driven by collaboration rather than profit.</p>
