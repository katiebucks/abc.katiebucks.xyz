## Who Am I?
I'm Katie Bucks, a writer, digital privacy advocate, and creator of this secure, privacy-first space on the web. This site is built to ensure autonomy, security, and the uncompromising protection of information. 

## Why This Site Exists
The internet should be a space of freedom, expression, and security. I believe in privacy, encryption, and the right to control our digital footprints. This website embodies those principles by being built with **zero tracking, no invasive scripts, and complete independence from third-party surveillance**.

## What Youâ€™ll Find Here
- **Articles** on privacy, security, and digital autonomy.
- **My personal insights** into maintaining security online.
