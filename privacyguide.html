        <h2>The Internet Is Not Your Friend</h2>
        <p class="section-text">Every click, search, and message you send is being logged—whether by your internet provider, Big Tech, advertisers, or government agencies. Privacy is no longer just a niche concern for tech-savvy users; it’s about safeguarding your identity, data, and freedom.</p>
        <p class="section-text">Still think this is paranoia? Watch <em>Snowden</em>—yes, the film from nearly 20 years ago. The surveillance programs exposed back then were alarming. Today, they’re far worse.</p>

    <section class="data-inference">
        <h2>Inferred Data</h2>
        <p class="section-text">Companies and governments track not just what you say online, but what you don’t say. This is known as inferred data.</p>
        <p>📌 <strong>You never told Facebook you were job hunting,</strong> but after searching for resume templates, LinkedIn ads flood your feed.</p>
        <p>📌 <strong>Your browsing habits suggest a political preference,</strong> so your social media starts nudging you in a certain direction.</p>
        <p>📌 <strong>Your purchase history and ad clicks</strong> flag you as a target for predatory loan offers.</p>

    <section class="dark-web">
        <h2>Dark Web 101: Tor</h2>
        <p>1️⃣ <strong>Download Tor Browser:</strong> Get it from <a href="https://www.torproject.org" target="_blank">torproject.org</a>.</p>
        <p>2️⃣ <strong>Install & Open:</strong> Set it up like any other browser.</p>
        <p>3️⃣ <strong>Click "Connect":</strong> Routes traffic through encrypted relays.</p>
        <p>4️⃣ <strong>Visit .onion Sites:</strong> Try sites like <a href="http://katiebucks.onion">katiebucks.onion</a> for anonymous browsing.</p>
        <p>5️⃣ <strong>Avoid Logging into Personal Accounts:</strong> Using Google or Facebook on Tor defeats the purpose.</p>
        <p>6️⃣ <strong>Disable JavaScript:</strong> Prevents tracking and potential leaks (adjust this in settings).</p>
        <p class="pro-tip"><strong>⚠️ Pro Tip:</strong> Never download anything from the dark web unless you fully understand the risks. Malicious files can expose your real identity—or worse.</p>

        <h2>Common Privacy Fails</h2>
        <p>🚨 <strong>Reusing Passwords:</strong> A single data breach could expose all your accounts.</p>
        <p>🔓 <strong>Not Encrypting Files:</strong> If your device is stolen, unprotected data is an open book.</p>
        <p>🐍 <strong>Downloading Unverified Software:</strong> If it’s not from an official source, assume it’s malware.</p>
